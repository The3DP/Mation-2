# Mation-2
After making "Mation," I decided to take it one step further by creating Mation-2. Mation-2 will become the new, improved, the bigger, and the better repository you know and love. Deployments are coming your way! Just stay patient. Now let's dig in and explore the incredible html animations which the "A" files have to offer.
# File Info
The "File Info" section contains detailed information for all of the "A" files.
Now instead of just copying and pasting a random file, you can tell what animation it holds.
| File          | Status   | Animation                  |
